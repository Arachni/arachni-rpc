    # There's one downside though, if you want to run this thing inside an
    # ::EM.run block: you'll have to wrap all sync calls in a ::Arachni::RPC::EM::Synchrony.run block.
    #
    # Like so:
    ::Arachni::RPC::EM::Synchrony.run do
        p bench.foo( 'First sync call in individual Synchrony block.' )
        # => "First sync call in individual Synchrony block."
    end

    # you can use it again individually
    ::Arachni::RPC::EM::Synchrony.run do
        p bench.foo( 'Second sync call in individual Synchrony block.' )
        # => "Second sync call in individual Synchrony block."
    end

    # or just wrap lots of calls in it
    ::Arachni::RPC::EM::Synchrony.run do
        p bench.foo( 'Third sync call in individual Synchrony block.' )
        # => "Third sync call in individual Synchrony block."

        p bench.foo( '--> And this one is in the same block as well.' )
        # => "--> And this one is in the same block as well."

        p bench.async_foo( 'This is a sync call to an async remote method.' )
        # => "This is a sync call to an async remote method."
    end

    # async calls are the same
    bench.foo( 'This is an async call... business as usual. :)' ) {
        |res|
        p res
        # => "This is an async call... business as usual. :)"
    }

    bench.async_foo( 'This is an async call to an async remote method.' ) {
        |res|
        p res
        # => "This is an async call to an async remote method."
    }


    #
    # The system uses 2 methods to make calls appear sync:
    #   - Threads (when the code is *not* run directly inside the Reactor's thread, see example.rb)
    #   - Fibers (when the code *is* run inside the Reactor's thread, like right here)
    #
    # For performance reasons callbacks are ::EM.defer'ed.
    #
    # This means that they're already in their own thread so you don't need
    # ::Arachni::RPC::EM::Synchrony.run to perform sync calls from inside callbacks.
    #
    bench.async_foo( 'Coo-coo' ) {
        |res|

        p res
